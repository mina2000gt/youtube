Do you know RSA?
It needs mathmatical knowledge.
If you can't understand it, please wait for a new video!!

===Hint For You===
main calculation:
encryption:
p = (some prime)
q = (some prime)
n = p*q
e = (some value)
m = (plain text)
c = pow(m, e, n)

decryption:
phi = (p-1)*(q-1)
d = pow(e, -1, phi)
m = pow(c, d, n)
