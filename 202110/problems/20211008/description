This challenge is in basic crypto style.
encode.py outputs out.txt and both files are given.
But in encode.py, flag is not written.
Please recover the flag!

SHA256 of flag:
7840f06fa05ecfcaec7fc634d6b8097fd498e7eca72e650c3f235b4b380d8857

hash your flag in file A by "sha256sum A" and compare with this!
